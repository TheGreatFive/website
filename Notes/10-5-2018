Task 1:
User log in (number 5 on pivot tracker) - persist the data to a database

Task 2:
UI for how the user's profile should look like once they log in - not too important but it's better to get ideas going now then later.
** Draw a template on the layout then start coding it

James and I (full-stack) will contribute to both tasks.
Task 1: Douglas, Daniel
Task 2: Nick

Important Reminders: choose good abstractions when coding your task. Also no spaghetti code please

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING :)
