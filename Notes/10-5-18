Task 1:

User log in (number 5 on pivot tracker) - persist the data to a database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2:

UI for how the user's profile should look like once they log in - not too important but it's better to get ideas going now then later.
* Draw a template off the layout on paper then start coding. We just need a rough skeleton code outline so that we can see the 
interactins between front end and back end.

One of the things to include: 
The user has to be able to see an icon of their friends profile picture (or maybe initials?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Reminders: 

1. choose good abstractions when coding your task. Also no spaghetti code please
2. Either fork (preferred) or create a new branch and once you commit your code we will all review it on Tuesday in class (maybe we should
shift meeting to Wednesday?)
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING :)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task for Everyone:

I need everyone to write a couple sentences (paragraph max is fine) about what we want in the user profile because this will help us 
know what back-end functionality we need to implement later on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roles

James and I (full-stack) will contribute to both tasks.
Task 1: Douglas, Daniel
Task 2: Nick

Goal by Wednesday
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have the back-end and front-end connected. The user should be able to log in. It should be persisted to database. The user should be able
to see their profile as well as any buttons or widgets we want to include in the front-end so that we can take the next steps in
adding more functionality. The UI does not have to be neatly organized nor do the icons have to be extravagant.
